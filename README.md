Mechanical properties are key to 3D printed concrete because they directly affect the load-bearing capacity and safety of the structure. The inherent complexity and variability of the material pose a challenge to accurately predict its mechanical properties.
In order to predict the compressive strength (CS) and flexural strength (FS), we consulted a lot of relevant literature, collected data used by predecessors, connected them in series, and finally obtained a dataset containing 254 CS test samples and 210 FS test samples.
We used four ML models, BP, random forest, XGBoost and CatBoost, for training, and the results were gratifying.
Adhering to the attitude of scientific research without boundaries and academic selflessness, we decided to make the dataset public for free, hoping to help researchers in need.
