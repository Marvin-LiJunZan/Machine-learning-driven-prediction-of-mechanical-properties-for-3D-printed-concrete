Mechanical properties are key to 3D printed concrete because they directly affect the load-bearing capacity and safety of the structure. The inherent complexity and variability of the material pose challenges to the accurate prediction of its mechanical properties.
In order to predict the compressive strength (CS) and flexural strength (FS), we consulted a large number of relevant literature, collected the data used by predecessors, and connected them in series. Finally, we obtained a dataset containing 254 CS data (CS workbook) and 210 FS data (FS workbook). The first and second columns of the dataset are the data sources, the second to the second to last columns are the feature variables, and the last column is the output variable CS/FS.
We used four ML models: BP, random forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost for training, and the results were quite satisfactory.
